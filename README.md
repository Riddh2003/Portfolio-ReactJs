# Title: Portfolio using react js
# Author Name: Riddh Modi
# Description: Created a personal portfolio website using React Js. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences with a clean and modern design. HTML structures the content, Tailwind CSS provides styling to ensure a visually appealing layout, and basic JavaScript, Hooks and Github data API fetching adds interactive elements for a dynamic user experience. This portfolio highlights my technical abilities and serves as a professional online presence to attract potential employers and collaborators.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
