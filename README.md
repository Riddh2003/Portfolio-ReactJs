# Title: Portfolio using react js
# Author Name: Riddh Modi
# Description: Created a personal portfolio website using React Js. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences with a clean and modern design. HTML structures the content, Tailwind CSS provides styling to ensure a visually appealing layout, and basic JavaScript, Hooks and Github data API fetching adds interactive elements for a dynamic user experience. This portfolio highlights my technical abilities and serves as a professional online presence to attract potential employers and collaborators.
